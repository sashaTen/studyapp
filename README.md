Researchers introduced a new method called "Distilling step-by-step" to train smaller language models effectively with less data. They leveraged explanations generated by large models as additional information for training. The results showed that their approach outperformed traditional methods by achieving better performance with over 50% less training data. Smaller models trained this way also surpassed larger models in efficiency, requiring significantly fewer parameters and reducing computational costs for deployment in real-world applications.

Pruning or simplifying SLMs can cause a significant degradation of downstream performance. To this end, we investigate weight reparameterization
and knowledge distillation as two avenues for these small language models



/////////////////////////////Specializing Smaller Language Models towards Multi-Step Reasoning

Our objective is to study what it takes to improve
smaller models’ chain-of-thought math reasoning

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.12726.pdf

The surprising ability of Large Language Models
(LLMs) to perform well on complex reasoning
with only few-shot chain-of-thought prompts is
believed to emerge only in very large-scale models (100+ billion parameters).

We show that such
abilities can, in fact, be distilled down from GPT3.5 (≥ 175B) to T5 variants (≤ 11B).

In summary, the proposal suggests that while large models have broad capabilities, small models can outperform them in specific tasks if their limited capacity is strategically concentrated on that particular task. The tradeoff involves sacrificing some generic abilities for improved performance in the targeted area. The experiment focuses on multi-step math reasoning to demonstrate and test this concept.

For the generic ability, we use BigBench Hard

CoT Reasoning on Maths Word Problems


math datasets (MultiArith, ASDiv, and SVAMP GSM8K




Experiment Approach:

They focus on multi-step math reasoning as the target task.
They fine-tune a smaller model (FlanT5) using knowledge distillation from a large teacher model (GPT-3.5).
The goal is to shift the model's focus from generic tasks to specialized math reasoning.
Results:

By sacrificing some performance in generic tasks, they manage to significantly improve the model's performance in multi-step math reasoning.
They use a model selection approach based on different math reasoning datasets to ensure broader applicability.
Challenges and Insights:

Addressing challenges like differences in tokenization, variations in performance during distillation, and trade-offs in model abilities.
Findings indicate that specializing smaller models can enhance their performance in specific tasks.
Conclusions:

The study deepens our understanding of how smaller models can excel in specific tasks when tailored through specialization.
The hope is that these findings can guide the development of strong, specialized smaller models accessible to a wider audience of researchers and practitioners.

we use distribution
matching as our training objective  that  compare   distribution  matches  of  teacher  and  student  models .

our specialized
11B model performance improves to be on par with LaMDA
137B and slightly below PaLM 60B, showing it is indeed
possible to make smaller models expert for the particular
math reasoning task. The price is also very clear: all specialized models suffer from performance drop on BigBench,
specifically, they lose all the CoT prompting abilities on
BBH, and a large portion of AO prompting performance.


We save one checkpoint every 10K instances/ updates, then
evaluate the checkpoints on (1). in-distribution math performance (GSM8K); (2). out-of-distribution math performance
(MultiArith, ASDiv, and SVAMP); (3). generic answeronly prompting performance (BBH-AO); (4). generic chainof-thought prompting performance (BBH-CoT)


the model’s ability
tradeoff not only happens on math v.s. generic ability, but
also happens on zero-shot v.s. in-context learning ability.

based on the statement "In-context data preserves zero-shot ability; Zero-shot data loses in-context ability," it suggests that using in-context data is recommended over zero-shot data. Here's the reasoning

utilizing LLM-generated rationales.
We first utilize CoT prompting to extract rationales from an LLM
We then use the generated rationales to train small task-specific models within a multi-task learning
framework where we prepend task prefixes to the input examples and train the model to output differently based on
the given task prefix.
