Researchers introduced a new method called "Distilling step-by-step" to train smaller language models effectively with less data. They leveraged explanations generated by large models as additional information for training. The results showed that their approach outperformed traditional methods by achieving better performance with over 50% less training data. Smaller models trained this way also surpassed larger models in efficiency, requiring significantly fewer parameters and reducing computational costs for deployment in real-world applications.

Pruning or simplifying SLMs can cause a significant degradation of downstream performance. To this end, we investigate weight reparameterization
and knowledge distillation as two avenues for these small language models



/////////////////////////////Specializing Smaller Language Models towards Multi-Step Reasoning

Our objective is to study what it takes to improve
smaller models’ chain-of-thought math reasoning

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.12726.pdf

The surprising ability of Large Language Models
(LLMs) to perform well on complex reasoning
with only few-shot chain-of-thought prompts is
believed to emerge only in very large-scale models (100+ billion parameters).

We show that such
abilities can, in fact, be distilled down from GPT3.5 (≥ 175B) to T5 variants (≤ 11B).

In summary, the proposal suggests that while large models have broad capabilities, small models can outperform them in specific tasks if their limited capacity is strategically concentrated on that particular task. The tradeoff involves sacrificing some generic abilities for improved performance in the targeted area. The experiment focuses on multi-step math reasoning to demonstrate and test this concept.

For the generic ability, we use BigBench Hard

CoT Reasoning on Maths Word Problems


math datasets (MultiArith, ASDiv, and SVAMP GSM8K




Experiment Approach:

They focus on multi-step math reasoning as the target task.
They fine-tune a smaller model (FlanT5) using knowledge distillation from a large teacher model (GPT-3.5).
The goal is to shift the model's focus from generic tasks to specialized math reasoning.
Results:

By sacrificing some performance in generic tasks, they manage to significantly improve the model's performance in multi-step math reasoning.
They use a model selection approach based on different math reasoning datasets to ensure broader applicability.
Challenges and Insights:

Addressing challenges like differences in tokenization, variations in performance during distillation, and trade-offs in model abilities.
Findings indicate that specializing smaller models can enhance their performance in specific tasks.
Conclusions:

The study deepens our understanding of how smaller models can excel in specific tasks when tailored through specialization.
The hope is that these findings can guide the development of strong, specialized smaller models accessible to a wider audience of researchers and practitioners.

we use distribution
matching as our training objective  that  compare   distribution  matches  of  teacher  and  student  models .

our specialized
11B model performance improves to be on par with LaMDA
137B and slightly below PaLM 60B, showing it is indeed
possible to make smaller models expert for the particular
math reasoning task. The price is also very clear: all specialized models suffer from performance drop on BigBench,
specifically, they lose all the CoT prompting abilities on
BBH, and a large portion of AO prompting performance.


We save one checkpoint every 10K instances/ updates, then
evaluate the checkpoints on (1). in-distribution math performance (GSM8K); (2). out-of-distribution math performance
(MultiArith, ASDiv, and SVAMP); (3). generic answeronly prompting performance (BBH-AO); (4). generic chainof-thought prompting performance (BBH-CoT)


the model’s ability
tradeoff not only happens on math v.s. generic ability, but
also happens on zero-shot v.s. in-context learning ability.

based on the statement "In-context data preserves zero-shot ability; Zero-shot data loses in-context ability," it suggests that using in-context data is recommended over zero-shot data. Here's the reasoning

///////////////research   directions  :
few  shot   learning .
in  context  learning .
promtp   engineering.
new  methods  of  transfering   knowledge .
utilizing LLM-generated rationales.
We first utilize CoT prompting to extract rationales from an LLM
We then use the generated rationales to train small task-specific models within a multi-task learning
framework where we prepend task prefixes to the input examples and train the model to output differently based on
the given task prefix.
just   do the     project    and   learn  how to   make  new  method  for the improving the metrics  over  others .

in bert    you  add    one   layer   and then   you  do   downstream  tasks.
there  two   stages   like   pre- training  and  fine-tuning.
we  only  can to   finetune  it  because   they  are  ready.   
bert   is   arcitechture  that  cinsists  from the  decoders .

transformers : 
rnn has  short  memory. 
they  are  not   parrelilzed.

trnasformers   for that  .

trans:
6  encoders   and  6  decoders . 
each   encoder  has  self  attention  layer and feed  forward nn.
each   decoder  has 2  masked multi head  attention   and   one   nn.
we feed  all   the  words   of input  at   the  same  time .   
each  token  is  compared  to the  other   and then   passed into  nn.
proccess  of  input   =   embed   .  positioning. 
because we  input   all  words   at same time it  does  not  know  the   position
so   thats  why   we   need   positional  encodings .
norm  layers   are   .

each   word  has    query  key and   value .   
after   complex  calculations   each  word gets  self attention  score.
then   we  add the   positional encodings

how   it   all  works   together   ? :
you   embedd   words  with   q , k , v  and   positional  embedding
then    you   pass in  encoders  and get the   output   .  
output  goes  to  decoder   .  and then    goes  to    softmax  and then   outputs .

///////////////////Orca 2: Teaching Small Language Models How to Reason:
It teaches smaller models various reasoning techniques instead of just copying bigger ones.
becase   simple   instruction  tuning  is  just mimicking  models. 
the   dataset  is  like the  triplet   = ['input prompt' ,  'instruction to solution' , 'reasoning'].
 "Cautious Reasoning" concept for Orca 2:

Identifying different types of tasks (simple, complex, etc.).
Choosing the best reasoning technique for each task.
Teaching the model how to apply the technique with less specific guidance.
Encouraging the model to think independently and choose the right approach on its own.
Prompt Erasing and how it helps Orca 2 develop independent reasoning skills.
instructions guide them through different reasoning strategies for various tasks.
prompts Erasing gradually removes these specific instructions.
This challenges the model to rely on its own reasoning abilities.
It doesn't just blindly follow instructions but can evaluate the situation, think strategically, and apply the most appropriate technique for each task, even without explicit guidance.
dataset comprises four main sources:
1 flan with instructions in this dataset are replaced with:
You are Orca, an AI language model created by Microsoft. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.
2 Few-Shot Data: To help the model learn from few-shot demonstrations, a dataset of 55K samples is created by reformatting data from the Orca 1 dataset.

3 math =160K math problems sourced from various datasets like Deepmind Math, GSM8K, AquaRat, MATH, AMPS, FeasibilityQA, NumGLUE, AddSub, GenArith, and Algebra.

4 Fully Synthetic Data: This includes 2000 synthetically created Doctor-Patient Conversations using GPT-4, followed by instructing the model to summarize these conversations in four sections. Two different prompts are used to guide the model, focusing on avoiding omissions or fabrications, thereby assessing the learning of specialized skills.



The evaluation of Orca 2 models covers various aspects of language model performance, including reasoning, language understanding, text completion, conversational abilities, grounding, and task-specific data handling.
