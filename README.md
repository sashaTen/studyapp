researchers train smaller task-specific models by either finetuning with human labels or distilling using LLMgenerated labels. 
Distilling step-by-step, a new mechanism.
Our method extracts LLM rationales as additional supervision for training small models within a multi-task framework.  
Maybe   multi   task  here   is   trying   to  predict  the   label  and   also   trying to  predict the rationale   .
 First, compared to both finetuning and distillation, our mechanism achieves better performance with much fewer labeled/unlabeled training examples. Second, compared to fewshot prompted LLMs, we achieve better performance using substantially smaller model sizes.
our finetuned 770M T5 model outperforms the few-shot prompted 540B PaLM..







Ideas   for  research    : 
Go  for   pre-trained   language  models . ..
smaller-scale tasks, work with smaller datasets, or focus on optimization techniques. However, for more resource-intensive tasks, consider accessing cloud-based platforms or using systems with more powerful hardware configurations.
