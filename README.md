Researchers introduced a new method called "Distilling step-by-step" to train smaller language models effectively with less data. They leveraged explanations generated by large models as additional information for training. The results showed that their approach outperformed traditional methods by achieving better performance with over 50% less training data. Smaller models trained this way also surpassed larger models in efficiency, requiring significantly fewer parameters and reducing computational costs for deployment in real-world applications.

Pruning or simplifying SLMs can cause a significant degradation of downstream performance. To this end, we investigate weight reparameterization
and knowledge distillation as two avenues for these small language models



/////////////////////////////Specializing Smaller Language Models towards Multi-Step Reasoning

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.12726.pdf

The surprising ability of Large Language Models
(LLMs) to perform well on complex reasoning
with only few-shot chain-of-thought prompts is
believed to emerge only in very large-scale models (100+ billion parameters).

We show that such
abilities can, in fact, be distilled down from GPT3.5 (≥ 175B) to T5 variants (≤ 11B).

In summary, the proposal suggests that while large models have broad capabilities, small models can outperform them in specific tasks if their limited capacity is strategically concentrated on that particular task. The tradeoff involves sacrificing some generic abilities for improved performance in the targeted area. The experiment focuses on multi-step math reasoning to demonstrate and test this concept.



Experiment Approach:

They focus on multi-step math reasoning as the target task.
They fine-tune a smaller model (FlanT5) using knowledge distillation from a large teacher model (GPT-3.5).
The goal is to shift the model's focus from generic tasks to specialized math reasoning.
Results:

By sacrificing some performance in generic tasks, they manage to significantly improve the model's performance in multi-step math reasoning.
They use a model selection approach based on different math reasoning datasets to ensure broader applicability.
Challenges and Insights:

Addressing challenges like differences in tokenization, variations in performance during distillation, and trade-offs in model abilities.
Findings indicate that specializing smaller models can enhance their performance in specific tasks.
Conclusions:

The study deepens our understanding of how smaller models can excel in specific tasks when tailored through specialization.
The hope is that these findings can guide the development of strong, specialized smaller models accessible to a wider audience of researchers and practitioners.
